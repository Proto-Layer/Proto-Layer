# Pseudo Language Documentation

## Chapter 1: Core Keywords

This chapter introduces the main keywords in Pseudo. Keywords define the structure and behavior of the language, allowing developers to write clear, reactive, and maintainable code.

**Key Keywords:**

- `when`: Enables reactive programming for handling events.
- `const`: Declares constants that cannot be changed.
- `def`: Defines functions with strict type enforcement.
- `return`: Returns a value from a function.
- `let`: Declares a block-scoped variable.
- `import` / `from`: Loads external modules or components into the current scope.

## Chapter 2: Built-In Functions

Pseudo provides a set of built-in functions that are always available without imports. These simplify common tasks and improve productivity.

**Key Functions:**

- `print()`: Outputs messages or variables to the console.
- `log()`: Records messages or transactions on the blockchain.
- `len()`: Returns the length of strings, lists, or dictionaries.
- `type()`: Determines the type of a variable or value.
- `input()`: Captures user input at runtime.
- `int()` / `decimal()`: Converts values and supports precise numeric operations.

## Chapter 3: Data Types

This chapter explains the core and custom data types in Pseudo. Types provide structure and safety, ensuring developers handle data correctly.

**Key Topics:**

- **Primitive Types:** `i32`, `i64`, `bool`, `str`, etc.
- **Custom Types:** `decimal`, `address`, `listener`, etc.
- **Collections:** `list`, `dict`, and nested structures.
- **Type Annotations:** Enforce variable types for clarity.
- **Type Casting:** Convert between types safely.
- **Constants and Immutability:** Use `const` to protect values from change.
