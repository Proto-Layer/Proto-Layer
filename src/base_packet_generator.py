"""
Every user type has a shared set of packet formats they will use 
to communicate over the network. This module centralizes those 
definitions to simplify debugging and consistency.

These represent user-initiated packets. Separate handlers manage
system or network-originated events.

NOTE: Some packet types may still need future expansion.
